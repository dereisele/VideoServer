# VideoServer
A python3 UPnP / DLNA video server


A bare essential video server for watching locally hosted mp4 files on a tv.


Requirements:

pip install Flask



Or for the Aiohttp version


pip intall aiohttp

pip intall aiohttp_jinja2

pip intall async_generator



Or for the Quart version ...a work in progress with some known issues...making it pretty unsable at the moment (Now that an aiohttp version exists this is probably dead).


pip intall aiofiles

pip install Quart
